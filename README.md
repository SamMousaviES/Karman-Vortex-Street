# von Karman Vortex Street Simulation with OpenFOAM 11

This repository contains configuration files for simulating the von Karman vortex street using OpenFOAM 11. The simulation setup includes a cylinder with a diameter of 0.04 meters placed in a channel 4.2 meters wide and 1 meter high, with an inlet velocity of 0.5 m/s. The boundary conditions are no slip for the upper and lower walls and the cylinder, a fixed velocity at the inlet, and a fixed pressure at the outlet.

For detailed steps on running the simulation and analyzing the results, refer to our blog post: [Understanding the von Karman Vortex Street with OpenFOAM 11](https://blog.sam-mousavi.com/2024/06/understanding-the-von-karman-vortex-street-with-openfoam-11/). You can also watch the velocity field around the cylinder in this [video](https://youtu.be/PKdfjxIRQ6M). Configuration files are available for download and further exploration.
